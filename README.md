# Bayesian Non-negative Matrix Factorization  

This repository includes:
-  a handout on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), basics of Bayesian statistics and Bayesian NMF,  
-  R implementations for the non-probabilistic NMF, Gibbs NMF and the ICM algorithm,  
-  R scripts for some experiments.  

All sources we used for making this project are listed at the end of the handout document.

#### Requirements
- R version 4.0.3, installed from: [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/).
